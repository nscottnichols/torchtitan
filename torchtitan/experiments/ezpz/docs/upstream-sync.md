# Upstream Sync Log

Tracks changes merged from `upstream/main` (pytorch/torchtitan) into the `ezpz`
branch, and any modifications required to keep `experiments/ezpz/{agpt,moe,qwen3}`
compatible.

## How to use this document

After each `git merge upstream/main`, check if the incoming commits touch:

1. **`models/llama3/`** — replay changes onto `experiments/ezpz/agpt/`
2. **`models/deepseek_v3/`** — replay changes onto `experiments/ezpz/moe/`
3. **`models/qwen3/`** — replay changes onto `experiments/ezpz/qwen3/`
4. **`models/common/`** — check if ezpz models depend on changed APIs
5. **`distributed/`** — check if ezpz trainer or parallelize files use removed/renamed APIs
6. **`trainer.py`** — check if ezpz trainer mirrors the same code path

Add an entry below with the date, upstream commits, what changed, and what
was required in ezpz.

## 2026-04-10 (3rd sync)

**Upstream commits:**

- `00b7f569` — [FSDP2] replace amp and replicate with fully_shard (#2900)
- `7ef10559` — add CITATION.cff file (#2925)
- `55658e93` — [RL] Make reference model and KL penalty optional (#2750)
- `6930593b` — [GraphTrainer] Add bitwise deterministic test to H100 CI (#2921)
- `e24e465c` — [GraphTrainer] Changed tagging flex_attn via graph_pass (#2924)

**Files changed in `models/llama3/` and `models/deepseek_v3/`:**

- `models/llama3/parallelize.py` — removed `apply_replicate`, removed
  `fsdp_enabled` / `dp_replicate_enabled` branching, always use `fully_shard`
- `models/deepseek_v3/parallelize.py` — same refactor as llama3

**Breaking changes in `distributed/`:**

- `distributed/utils.py` — removed `maybe_enable_amp()` function. AMP is now
  handled internally by `fully_shard`'s `MixedPrecisionPolicy`.

**Changes required in ezpz:**

| File | Change | Commit |
|------|--------|--------|
| `agpt/parallelize.py` | Removed `apply_replicate`, removed `fsdp_enabled` branching, always use `fully_shard` | `5930b392` |
| `moe/parallelize.py` | Same: removed `apply_replicate` import and usage, always use `fully_shard` | `5930b392` |
| `trainer.py` | Removed `maybe_enable_amp` references (2 locations) | `6a2a09ec` |

## 2026-04-10 (2nd sync)

**Upstream commits:**

- `5470cc7e` — GQAttention: Combine `q_norm` and `k_norm` into `qk_norm` (#2872)
- `4b45999f` — [GraphTrainer] Add FlexAttention bitwise deterministic tests (#2903)

**Files changed in `models/llama3/` and `models/deepseek_v3/`:**

- Neither `models/llama3/` nor `models/deepseek_v3/` changed.

**Breaking changes in `models/common/`:**

- `models/common/attention.py` — `GQAttention.Config` renamed `q_norm` and
  `k_norm` fields to a single `qk_norm` field. Removed the `__post_init__`
  validation that checked both were set together.

**Changes required in ezpz:**

| File | Change | Commit |
|------|--------|--------|
| `qwen3/__init__.py` | Updated 12 config entries from `q_norm=..., k_norm=...` to `qk_norm=...` | `4fe7aa48` |

`agpt` and `moe` were unaffected — `agpt` doesn't use QK norms, and `moe` has
its own `q_norm` field on a custom `DeepSeekAttention` config (not `GQAttention`).

## 2026-04-10 (1st sync)

**Upstream commits:**

- `8328876d` — [RL] Fix RL h100 workflow + `enable_gqa` flag in attention (#2891)
- `3c811045` — [GraphTrainer] Document aot_fx_trace compilation mode (#2912)

**Files changed in `models/llama3/` and `models/deepseek_v3/`:**

- Neither changed.

**Changes in `models/common/`:**

- `models/common/attention.py` — added `enable_gqa` parameter to
  `FlexAttention.forward()` and `ScaledDotProductAttention.forward()`.
  The ezpz branch already had the `VarlenAttention` forwarding for
  `enable_gqa`, which matched the upstream addition — no conflict.

**Changes required in ezpz:**

- None. Clean merge.
